### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main files:

- **main.dart**: Entry point for the application, where the `MyApp` widget is defined.
- **counter_functions_screen.dart**: Contains the `CounterFuntionsScreen` widget, which represents the main screen of the app.
- **custom_button.dart**: Defines the `CustomButton` widget, which is a reusable custom floating action button.

### How to Use

1. Launch the app, and you will be presented with the main screen.
2. The counter value is displayed in a large font at the center of the screen.
3. Use the floating action buttons at the bottom to interact with the counter:
   - **Refresh Button**: Resets the counter to 0.
   - **Add Button**: Increments the counter.
   - **Remove Button**: Decrements the counter (disabled when the counter is already 0).

### Code Overview

- **MyApp Class**: The main application class that sets up the theme and initializes the `CounterFuntionsScreen`.
- **CounterFuntionsScreen Class**: Represents the main screen of the app. It utilizes the `_CounterFuntionsScreenState` to manage the state of the counter.
- **CustomButton Class**: A reusable custom floating action button that takes an icon and an `onPressed` callback.
